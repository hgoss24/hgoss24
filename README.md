# Hello!
I'm Hassan and currently a student at Arizona State learning the ins and outs of web design. I hope to gain as much knowledge as I can while I'm here so I can apply all the information in a career setting. Coding is a bit overwhelming but I am always up for the challange :joy:

A few of my hobbie are reading, listening to music and doing puzzles.

I also really enjoy doing photography ðŸ™‚
